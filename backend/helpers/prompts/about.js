# About Layer-E

Layer-E is working on no-code tools to help brands and creators add a web3 layer over their existing business/platform. Our focus is on the adoption of NFTs and Web3 technology, building utility-led tools for protocols to have a sustainable ecosystem.

We are at the forefront of innovation in the web3 space. As long-time students and enthusiasts of both technologies, we want to make a meaningful contribution to both product and narrative.

# 🔭 Humanizing Tokens With Culture

[Layer-E](https://layer-e.com) is building **Composable Culture Collectibles for Creators and Companies.**

That’s a mouthful! So what does that mean?

We’re a platform for a new primitive of collectibles, that rethinks user engagement in web3; built for consumer brands and forward thinking creators.

Collectibles are a file format, not the destination. We’re the first time collectibles can do something unique, for a crypto-naive audience, at Social Media scale. The Layer-E suite of products is the perfect solution for anyone looking to make their mark in the world of NFTs and web3, and tap into the immense revenue potential of this rapidly growing industry. Our collectible-first approach allows companies and creators to build strong, authentic connections with their audience, and stand out in a crowded marketplace.

# 🎯 The Layer-E Product Stack

The results from SEO and cookies-based user engagement is getting progressively narrower for brands. Collectibles represent the next paradigm shift. Layer-E’s CRM product suite leverages the ease of use and distribution of web2, along with the privacy and security of web3.

**The Layer-E product exists across the spectrum of Identity, Immersion and Interaction.**

This is what the Soul, the Biome and the Backstage products power. They are complemented with an NFT tooling and analytics stack that we call the Surfaceboard. Together they combine to become the Collectible Relationship Management engine for Brands and Creators.
